React Portfolio

## Description
This portfolio was created to be able to share my projects while I'm applying for jobs or working as a freelancer. Another purpose it serves is to be able to share my work with other developers and collaborate on projects. I struggled with getting images to render correctly, but found the correct paths in the end. Also I tried to make my resume downloadable while it was in the src folder, but eventually I realized that it needed to go in the public folder. 


## Installation
n/a

## Usage

Upon arrival to the page you are greeted with the about me as the default page on load. You can use the nav bar to switch between About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume. They contain information about me and a few projects that I am proud to display. Since there is no server side, the logic for the form submit in the Contact page is incomplete, but will alert you that message was sent and a note explaining that it's purpose is for client-side demo. You can also download my resume in the Resume page. Currently, there is a placement number in place of my phone number and a partial address.
